            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Driven by a passion for technology, I have honed strong software development skills, focusing on problem-solving and performance optimization. With an adaptable and proactive mindset, I thrive in dynamic environments, continuously learning and contributing innovative solutions to real-world challenges.

Beyond software development, I have engaged in diverse tech projects across multiple fields within computer science. My experience extends to IoT, where I developed smart traffic lights and access control systems using C++ and Arduino Kitsâ€”demonstrating my ability to build intelligent, automated solutions. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in a BlockOps project, where I was entrusted with designing the architecture, ensuring seamless functionality and scalability.

I also possess in-depth knowledge of money counting machines, enabling me to detect and resolve issues, perform maintenance, and even assemble them from the ground up. My hands-on approach extends to troubleshooting and repairing computers for individuals, reinforcing my ability to tackle real-world technological challenges efficiently.

With a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, I continually seek opportunities to leverage technology in meaningful and impactful ways.</p>
